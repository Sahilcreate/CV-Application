* made the `components` necessary for `live preview`
* added functionality to `Fill example` & `Clear` buttons
* I am currently facing challenge on how to make the `uuid` of each keypoints or each techstack. Do i have to pass eventhandler of each and every buttons in form from `App` itself. I will think about it tomorrow.
